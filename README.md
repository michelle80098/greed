# Greed
Anyone can relate to that empty feeling or strong motivation that leads them to 
wander or sprint about life looking for something to satisfy their hunger. For
some of us it's a good burger from reputable fast food place, for others it's 
a clean car, yet for others it is hitting left and right arrows on a keyboard collecting rocks and gems for our own selfish purposes. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 rfk 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
---
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- greed                 (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific game classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (entry point for program)
